# Third-Party-API-s
created the base files that will be needed.
copied over the files that were provided.
Added more divs to get a full workday planner.
linked bootstrap with the html.
Trying to set up the columns in 9 AM if it works there then I'll copy pasta.
Made a column.
Put a Span in that column.
Worked!
Focusing on the HTML and not the CSS so it's looking a bit scuffed.
I fell like i've made a mess of the code.
Commented out all the css I felt was unnecessary so now I feel alot less confused.
Can't get the Icon button bigger or to save.
Got it to work now just have to copy pasta.
Wanna make the input look more seamless but that can wait.
